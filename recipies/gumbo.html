   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <p>First you want to prepare your ingredients. Dice up celery, bellpepper, garlic, and onion. cut the andoullie sausage into coins. pour a bit of oil into a baking dish and season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Bake the chicken at 450 degrees. while chicken is baking you will make the roux.</p>
<p>In order to make the roux you will need to pour a generous ammount of your cooking oil into a dutch oven. Heat the oil on medium high and mix in your flour. you need to stir the flour oil mixture for about 45 minutes. keep in mind if you do not continuously sitr the oil flour mixture it will burn to the bottomn of the dutch oven, thus creating a mess to clean up and will ruin your roux. you will know that the roux is done when it is the color of a hersheys chocolate bar and a nice burnt smell is filling up the kitchen</p>
<p>about 25 minutes after you put the chicken in take it out of the oven. once the chicken is out you can shred it up with a fork leaving large chunks of chicken. set aside.</p>
<p>once your roux is the right color you want to put the celery, onion, and bellpepper into it and mix it around. it will cook very quickly so make sure you are paying attention. after the onion becomes translucent take a little beer and deglaze it. after you will pour in your chicken stock. put the chicken and andoullie and garlic into the broth, while you are doing this make sure that you are getting all the juices and burnt peices from the baking dish into the stew.</p>
<p>After all is in cover the dutch oven and let it cook for 3 hours and enjoy the masterpeice you have created</p>
